![alt text](img/fieldfinders-logo.png)

[Field Finders](http://field-finder.herokuapp.com/)

Have you ever planned to play sport with friends and not known where your nearest field was? Or how about trying to find any sporting field when you move to a new city? Field Finders uses the most up to date data from the City of Seattle to connect you to your sporting field of choice.

Up for a swim? Want to play basketball? Have you ever even heard of Pickleball? Seattle Field Finder will connect you to a huge range of different city run sporting facilities located all round the city. Start searching and get out onto the field

Our search results provide users with:
- Park address
- How many courts or fields the park has
- If the feature had lighting
- Driving directions to get you to the park
